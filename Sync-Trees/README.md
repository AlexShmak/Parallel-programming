# Binary Search Trees with synchronization mechanisms

### The following synchronization mechanisms are implemented:

- Hard synchronization
- Soft synchronization
- Optimistic synchronization

### Testing

Each of the tree data structures are tested on a set of unit-tests to verify:

- Correct concurrent ***node insertion***
- Correct concurrent ***node deletion***
- Correct concurrent combined (***insert, delete, search***)
